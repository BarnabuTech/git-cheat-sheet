# Git & GitHub for Beginners

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so you can recall specific versions later. It's like a time machine for your projects, allowing you to track changes, see who made them, and revert to previous versions if needed.

## Why Use Git?

- **Track Changes**: See what was changed, when, and by whom
- **Collaboration**: Work on the same project with others without conflicts
- **Backup**: Your code is stored both locally and remotely
- **Experimentation**: Try new features without breaking your working code

## Basic Git Commands

### Setting Up

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Starting a Repository

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Clone an existing repository
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Making Changes

```bash
# Check status of working directory
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add <file>     # Add specific file
git add .          # Add all changes

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Descriptive message about changes"
```

### Working with Branches

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature-branch

# List all branches
git branch

# Switch between branches
git checkout branch-name

# Merge branches
git merge branch-name
```

### Working with Remote Repositories

```bash
# Add a remote repository
git remote add origin <repository-url>

# Push changes to remote
git push -u origin main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main
```

## GitHub Basics

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It provides a graphical interface and additional features like issue tracking and project management.

### Key GitHub Concepts

- **Repository (repo)**: A project's files and revision history
- **Fork**: A personal copy of someone else's project
- **Pull Request (PR)**: Proposing changes to someone else's repository
- **Issues**: Track bugs, enhancements, or tasks

### GitHub Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. Create a new **branch** for your changes
4. Make your changes and **commit** them
5. **Push** your changes to your fork
6. Create a **Pull Request** to the original repository

## Best Practices

1. Write clear, concise commit messages
2. Make small, focused commits
3. Create branches for new features or fixes
4. Keep your main branch clean and stable
5. Pull before you push to avoid conflicts
6. Use .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files

## Common Issues & Solutions

- **Merge conflicts**: Edit the conflicted file, then `git add` and `git commit`
- **Undo local changes**: `git checkout -- <file>`
- **Undo last commit**: `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
- **View commit history**: `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`
